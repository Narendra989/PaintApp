# PaintApp
Demo paint app

This is a basic ‘Paint’ type app, which has following capabilities - 

1. It allows user to draw on the screen by touching and dragging their finger across the screen.
2. User can select any colour from the colour palette.
3. User can also select the eraser from the top of the colour palette to clear the drawing
4. Drawings are auto saved to reduce loss of data

For now this app has following limitations - 

1. For now user can work on single image at a time as the app uses local storage to store data, need to change that to Sqlite to support working on and saving multiple drawings
